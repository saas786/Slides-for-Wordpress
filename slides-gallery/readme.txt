Slides Gallery replaces the built in gallery functionality with a slideshow using the very awesome Slides.js plugin by Nathan Searles (http://slidesjs.com/). 

As such, it's a really simple and minimalistic plugin; simply activate, and your galleries look a bit nicer, and are a bit more interactive and fast loading. No need to flip through several HTML pages, when you can quickly brush through the entire gallery in one place. You can <a href="http://noscope.com/journal/2009/03/carousel-gallery-jquery-for-wordpress">see a demo</a>.

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you.

This plugin is based heavily on the Carousel Gallery plugin by joen (http://noscope.com/journal/2009/03/carousel-gallery-jquery-for-wordpress). Thanks!

== Description ==

This plugin tweaks the gallery tag ([gallery]) in Wordpress by replacing it with the Slides.js plugin. 

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the plugin, put it in your "plugins" folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins section.

== F.A.Q. ==

= How do I change the layout =
You can choose one of the predefined themes, and edit the layout yourself in the CSS folder for the respective theme. 
Alternately, you can choose "Manual", set all of the options yourself, and edit the CSS in your main CSS files.

= How do I change the image and thumbnail sizes =
Slides Gallery uses the Wordpress Media settings for this (Settings -> Media).
You can control which image size is used in the settings page for the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. This shows the default look of the gallery. When you click the "Next" button, the large image slides to the left and the next thumbnail is shown large.

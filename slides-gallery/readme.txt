Slides Gallery replaces the built in gallery functionality with a slideshow using the very awesome Slides.js plugin by Nathan Searles (http://slidesjs.com/). 

As such, it's a really simple and minimalistic plugin; simply activate, and your galleries look a bit nicer, and are a bit more interactive and fast loading. No need to flip through several HTML pages, when you can quickly brush through the entire gallery in one place. You can <a href="http://noscope.com/journal/2009/03/carousel-gallery-jquery-for-wordpress">see a demo</a>.

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you.

This plugin is based heavily on the Carousel Gallery plugin by joen (http://noscope.com/journal/2009/03/carousel-gallery-jquery-for-wordpress). Thanks!

== Description ==

This plugin tweaks the gallery tag ([gallery]) in Wordpress by replacing it with the Slides.js plugin. 

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the plugin, put it in your "plugins" folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins section.

== F.A.Q. ==

= How do I change the layout =
Most of the design, you have to do using CSS. Fortunately there are lots of classes to hook into.

= How do I change the image and thumbnail sizes =
Carousel Gallery uses the Wordpress Media settings for this (Settings -> Media).

Since version 1.5, you can also add the width/height of thumbnails in the Carousel Gallery options page. These are, however, scaled down using CSS, and could suffer in quality.

== Screenshots ==

1. This shows the default look of the gallery. When you click the "Next" button, the large image slides to the left and the next thumbnail is shown large.

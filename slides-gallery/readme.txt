Stable tag: trunk

Slides Gallery replaces the built in gallery functionality with a slideshow using the very awesome Slides.js plugin by Nathan Searles (http://slidesjs.com/). 

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you.

This plugin is based heavily on the Carousel Gallery plugin by joen (http://noscope.com/journal/2009/03/carousel-gallery-jquery-for-wordpress). Thanks!

== Description ==

This plugin tweaks the gallery tag ([gallery]) in Wordpress by replacing it with the Slides.js plugin. 

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the plugin, put it in your "plugins" folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins section.

== F.A.Q. ==

= How do I change the layout =
Most of the design, you have to do using CSS. Fortunately there are lots of classes to hook into.

= How do I change the image and thumbnail sizes =
The thumb sizes are editable in the settings. The "Large" size is used for the main image.
